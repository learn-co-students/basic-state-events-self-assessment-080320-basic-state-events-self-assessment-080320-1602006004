# Good Drake, Bad Drake

## Deliverables

- Here are two objects with two image links:

   > `{"yes-image": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQptvy1IuxkMzOgcsR_uWucIkwE67jI04GfUg&usqp=CAU", "yes-statement": "google the answer"}`
   
   > `{"no-image": "https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ElaborateShinyBernesemountaindog-size_restricted.gif", "no-statment": "learn problem solving, syntax, reading documentation"  }`

- Your goal is to make your app look like the attached wireframe. There should be a statement and underneath that statement is an applicable "yes" or "no" image. 

- When the image is clicked, it should switch from the "no" image and statement to the "yes" image and statement. When clicked a second time it should flip again. 

You are only given an `App.js` file and an `objects.js` file which creates the two objects mentioned. Use all the tools you have learned to build this app in the way you feel is best. CSS is not mandatory but should be worked on if you have time remaining.
